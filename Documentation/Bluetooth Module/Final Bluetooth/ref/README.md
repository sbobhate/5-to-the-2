Here are some materials that I used during my research.
Grab them if you are interested in socket programming.

for the java code, make sure that you hava JDK installed and put the bin folder under the system environmental variables -"PATH"
then you can compile the source by typing "javac source_name.java", and run the source_name.class by typing "java source_name"

for the android code, you might have to import into to android ADT under option from "existing code".

for the python code, make sure that you have python 3.3 installed and change the environmental variable "PATH" accordingly.
